# Quora-Duplicate-Question-Detection
In the evolving landscape of digital knowledge sharing, ensuring that each logically similar question exists only once in a platform’s repository presents a significant challenge. This challenge is particularly acute on platforms like Quora, a
question-and-answer website, where identifying duplicate questions is essential.
This project delves into using machine learning techniques to tackle this issue
using models such as Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and SVM and BERT pretrained
model. The study examines the impact of various text representation techniques
such as Bag of Words, Word2Vec, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), and BERT embeddings. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning
models, the study explores the nuances of semantic understanding in text. Text
preprocessing methods are employed to refine the models’ ability to discern subtle
differences and similarities in question phrasing. Out of all the models, XGBoost
along with Bag of words text representation gave us the highest F1-score of 0.86.
This comparative analysis is key in enhancing the efficiency of information retrieval and knowledge sharing on question-and-answer platforms, shedding light
on the strengths and limitations of each model in detecting duplicate questions.
